I was actively making Chrome Conflict (Steel Sentinels 2) so did not pursue further development. \r\n\r\nI resumed development of Arcanists 2 on the 3rd of February, 2019 after receiving the original games artwork, music, and sound effects.\r\n    \r\n    My motivation behind recreating Arcanists was a mixture of my love to code, Arcanists being a great game, it no longer being playable, and no other remake coming close to the mark (something like 5 different remakes?). I was actively playing Runescape when Funorb was released and played off and on throughout Funorb's lifespan playing every game at least once and enjoying most of them.\r\n\r\n    I had originally planned to take a week or two to make the core game as close to the original as possible then throw it on the Funorb discord server for the 20 or so active people to play and then let it die again. Plans changed however when I told the other members of the Chrome Conflict dev team about my side project and they then proceeded to make a dedicated discord server and name it The REAL Arc2 (TRA2). The project was kept in the dark until the public release, however popularity grew rapidly as more and more found out about it and the community took it upon themselves to help grow the community by creating Youtube videos, making a website, streaming on Twitch, and posting about it everywhere. So a shout out to all involved!"
